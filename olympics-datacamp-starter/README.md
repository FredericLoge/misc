DATACAMP - 1st OCT 2022
EXED, Frédéric Logé

Objective: analyze the datasets of Olympians and practicing what has been seen in past sessions:
- data manipulation and visualization
- unsupervised learning (dimension reduction)

Several questions can be raised:
* How did sports change throughout time ?
  Nb of participants, diversity of genders, countries, ...
* Can we predict which country is gonna be #1 reliably ?
* Can we forecast future number of participants ?
* Is there cluster of participants in terms of height/weight/sport etc ?
